    UVP Tools 2.2.0.xxx
The following is the readme file of UVP Tools 2.2.0. From the readme file, you will learn what a UVP Tools project is, how source code of UVP Tools is structured, and how UVP Tools is installed.

What Is a UVP Tools Project?

UVP Tools is a tool that integrates the Xen front-end driver and uvp-monitor (virtual machine monitoring program). It is designed for use on virtual machines (VMs) equipped with a 32-bit x86-based CPU (386 or higher) or x86_64 CPU.

The Xen front-end driver improves I/O processing efficiency of VMs. The uvp-monitor helps administrators gain visibility into VM running status.

Components of the Xen front-end driver:

  - xen-platform-pci driver: Xen front-end pci driver, which provides xenbus access, establishes event channels, and grants references.
  - xen-balloon driver: Xen front-end balloon driver, which adjusts VM memory through the host.
  - xen-vbd/xen-blkfront driver: Xen front-end disk driver.
  - xen-vnif/xen-netfront driver: Xen front-end NIC driver.
  - xen-scsi/xen-scsifront driver: Xen front-end PV SCSI driver.
  - xen-procfs driver: provides the xenbus driver and adapts to the VMs that use pvops kernel but does not provide /proc/xen/xenbus or /dev/xen/xenbus interfaces.
  - vni driver: virtio driver.

Features of uvp-monitor:
  - Collects information about resource usage of every VM and periodically writes the information into domain0 through xenstore. The resource usage information includes the total number of CPUs. CPU usage, memory capacity, memory usage, disk capacity, disk usage, and the number of packets received or sent by a NIC.
  - Collects VM hostnames and writes them into domain0 through xenstore.
  - Notifies domain0 whether the current VM supports hot-plug of memory, CPUs, and disks.
  - Facilitates live migration of Xen VMs and triggers VMs to send gARP and ndp packets to the network at completion of live migration.
  - Facilitates self-upgrade of UVP Tools on VMs. The uvp-monitor works with xenstore to notify domain0 of the UVP Tools version installed on VMs. If the UVP Tools version on a VM is different from the UVP Tools version on the host, the UVP Tools on the VM is then automatically upgraded to the version installed on the host.

Installing UVP Tools
  - Obtain the UVP Tools source code package. Save the UVP Tools source code package to a directory on the Linux VM where UVP Tools will be installed, and unpack the UVP Tools source code package. Be sure that you have the permission to access this directory.
    - If the downloaded UVP Tools source code package is an official release, run the following command: 

        tar -xzf UVP-Tools-2.2.0.xxx.tar.gz

        Or

        gunzip UVP-Tools-2.2.0.xxx.zip

    - If the downloaded UVP Tools source code package is a source code package of the master branch, run the following command: 

        gunzip UVP-Tools-master.zip

	
    The Linux VM where UVP Tools will be installed must come with gcc, make, libc, and kernel-devel. For simplicity purposes, the Linux VM where UVP Tools will be installed is referred to as the Linux VM.

  - Go to the uvp-monitor directory. Run the following command to build uvp-monitor:

        make

        Note:
        (1). When uvp-monitor is being built, the make tool automatically downloads the xen-4.1.2.tar.gz source code package from the Internet. If the download fails, uvp-monitor cannot be successfully built. If the Linux VM cannot access the Internet, manually obtain the xen-4.1.2.tar.gz source code package, and save it to the uvp-monitor directory.

        (2). The uvp-monitor program used to statically build the libxenstore is provided along with the UVP Tools. Using such a uvp-monitor program can avoid the uvp-monitor failure due to defects in the default libxenstore.so shared library file of the Linux-based VM. For example, the default libxenstore.so file of the CoreOS 1010.5.0-based VM is defective and its directory /usr cannot be modified. To address this problem, install the uvp-monitor program that is used to statically build the libxenstore.

    To install the uvp-monitor that is used to dynamically build the libxenstore, run the following command:

        make install
    To install the uvp-monitor that is used to statically build the libxenstore, run the following command:

        make install_static

    Note: If you need to build the uvp-monitor in a cross-compilation environment, put the source code of the uvp-monitor in the cross-compilation environment, and then install the built uvp-monitor on the target VM.


  - Build the Xen front-end driver. Take SLES 11 SP3 x86_64 as an example.
    - Go to the uvp-xenpv/uvp-classic_xen_driver-2.6.32to3.0.x directory.
    - Run the following command to build the Xen front-end driver:

        make KERNDIR="/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build" BUILDKERNEL=$(uname -r)
  
    After the Xen front-end driver is successfully built, run the following command to install the Xen front-end driver:

        make KERNDIR="/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build" BUILDKERNEL=$(uname -r) modules_install

        Note: This operation may replace the Xen front-end driver provided by the OS vendor with the one provided by UVP Tools. 

    If the Xen front-end driver used by the Linux VM is not provided by UVP Tools, uninstall it. Take the SLES 11 SP3 x86_64 as an example. 
    - Run the following command to check whether the Linux VM is armed with the Xen front-end driver provided by the OS vendor. 

        rpm -qa | grep xen-kmp
    - If a command output is returned, the Linux VM is armed with the Xen front-end driver provided by the OS vendor. Then, run the following command to uninstall the Xen front-end driver: 

        rpm -e xen-kmp-default-4.2.2_04_3.0.76_0.11-0.7.5

        Note: "xen-kmp-default-4.2.2_04_3.0.76_0.11-0.7.5" is merely an example. Replace it with the Xen front-end driver installed on the Linux VM. 

  Alternatively, you can use the build_tools script to build a UVP Tools installation package for the Linux VM. Take SLES 11 SP3 x86_64 as an example. 
  - After the UVP Tools source code package is unpacked, run the following command in the UVP-Tools-2.2.0.xxx directory to build the UVP Tools installation package: 

        make all

  A directory named uvp-tools-linux-2.2.0.xxx is generated in the current directory after the make all command is run. Go to the uvp-tools-linux-2.2.0.xxx directory and run the following command to execute the UVP Tools installation script install. 

        ./install

    Note: If you want to know what the install script has done, run the sh -x install command to print script execution information, or read through the script. 


  After the UVP Tools installation script has been installed successfully, run the following command to start the UVP Tools service. 

        service uvp-monitor start

    Note: If the uvp-monitor service start failed, you should restart your VM to start service.
